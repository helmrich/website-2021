### About

Kisetsu was the final project of my iOS Nanodegree at Udacity. It was an Anime and Manga tracking app for iOS written in Swift 3 that used the [AniList](https://anilist.co/) REST API. As I'm a huge Anime fan it was a blast writing this app.

However, when the AniList API was migrated to GraphQL I heavy-heartedly decided to discontinue the app as I wanted to focus on my studies full-time at that time.
