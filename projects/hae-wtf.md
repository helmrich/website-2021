### About

[hä? WTF!](https://hae.wtf/) was created by four fellow students and myself during our 4th semester at HdM Stuttgart as a semester project. It is a trivia quiz game based on questions provided by the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) API.

Besides taking part in developing the frontend and a few minor parts of the backend for the web app I was also more heavily involved in the DevOps side of things than ever before, using Docker as a development environment and for deployment on a server instance and (trying) setting up a CI/CD pipeline for the first time. To be honest, I was really struggling with DevOps and it was hard for me and a fellow student to get things up and running.

During this project I both realized even more that I'm more passionate about the creative side of application development, combining design and development which involves instant feedback most of the time but also that there are and always will be so many things to learn which can be frustrating at times but is also the fun and interesting part of being a software developer.
