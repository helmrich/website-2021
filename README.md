## About

This is my new website written in TypeScript and built with React and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), [react-intersection-observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer), [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked). I wanted to have an easy way to add projects I worked on and associated informations which is why I used gray-matter and marked to be able to write project descriptions as markdown and add infos as front matter.

## Goals

I actually planned to make the site feel more "alive" right from the start by using the awesome [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library and adding 3D models, backgrounds, etc. to add some motion and visual candy but unfortunately I haven't progressed as far on my three.js learning journey as I planned yet and can't create 3D models I'm actually proud of using, which is why I'm going to add this later on, so stay tuned! üòÅ

## TODOs

These are some of the things I want to improve and work on in the foreseeable future:

* [ ] Add 3D models and backgrounds
* [ ] Improve dark mode

## Bugs

If you find bugs (and I *know* there are still plenty ü•≤), accessibility issues or any other problem, I would really appreciate it if you just let me know by reaching out to me or opening an issue.
